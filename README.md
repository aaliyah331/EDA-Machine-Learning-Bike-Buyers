This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a bike, based on demographic and lifestyle features. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification modeling using Python.

Objectives; Clean and preprocess a real-world dataset -- Perform exploratory data analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib -- Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder -- Build and evaluate classification models (Decision Tree & Random Forest) -- Predict bike purchases based on input features 

Tools & Libraries; Python 3 -- pandas, numpy – data manipulation -- matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization -- scikit-learn – preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation -- Jupyter Notebook

Files; Bike_Buyers.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with full pipeline from EDA to modeling -- bike_buyers.csv – Source dataset used in the analysis

How to Run; Clone this repo -- Install dependencies -- Open the notebook -- Follow the code to view preprocessing, EDA, and classification logic
